This is my solutions to the challenge problems for Learning Cocoa, 3rd Edition.

I've attempted every challenge except for Challenge 31, the memory leak challenge.

At some point, I'll also start adding little prototypes that I create to solve other interesting problems that I run into while developing. Don't count on any of that code to be perfectly commented. I intend to move too fast to do that. I do intend to make the source itself self-documenting (as much as possible, anyway).

To recursively build all projects in debug mode:

$ find . -name "*.xcodeproj" -execdir xcodebuild debug \;

To recursively clean:

$ find . -name "*.xcodeproj" -execdir xcodebuild clean \;

or, if you want to clean really fast (but the results are mostly silent):

$ find . -name "*.xcodeproj" -execdir rm -rf ./build \;

If you have any questions, you can always reach me at sam.krishna@gmail.com.
