The "AnguishBuckYacktman" directory contains my Leopard versions of the 2003 Cocoa Programming book by the authors. The book is out-of-print, but you can read the book on-line here:

The "Hillegass" directory contains my solutions to the challenge and chapter problems for Learning Cocoa, 3rd Edition.

I've attempted every challenge in Learning Cocoa except for Challenge 31, the memory leak challenge.

At some point, I'll also start adding little prototypes that I create to solve other interesting problems that I run into while developing. Don't count on any of that code to be perfectly commented. I intend to move too fast to do that. I do intend to make the source itself self-documenting (as much as possible, anyway).

NOTE: I added a modified version of the ViewController project by Kathy Shive and Jonathon Damm. You can read about it here:
http://katidev.com/blog/2008/05/26/nsviewcontroller-the-new-c-in-mvc-pt-3-of-3/. I added some code from CodeSnipler to make the XSSplitViewController to resize the NSSplitView like the Apple single-window apps like iTunes, iPhoto, etc.

To recursively build all projects in debug mode:

$ find . -name "*.xcodeproj" -execdir xcodebuild debug \;

To recursively clean:

$ find . -name "*.xcodeproj" -execdir xcodebuild clean \;

or, if you want to clean really fast (but the results are mostly silent):

$ find . -name "*.xcodeproj" -execdir rm -rf ./build \;
