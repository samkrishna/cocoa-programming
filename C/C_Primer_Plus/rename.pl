Usage: rename expr [files]

This script's first argument is Perl code that alters the filename (stored in \$_ ) to reflect how you want the file renamed. It can do thi
+s because it uses an eval to do the hard work. It also skips rename calls when the filename is untouched. This lets you simply use wildcar
+ds like rename EXPR * instead of making long lists of filenames.

Here are five examples of calling the rename program from your shell:

% rename 's/\.orig\$//'  *.orig
% rename 'tr/A-Z/a-z/ unless /^Make/'  *
% rename '$_ .= ".bad"'  *.f
% rename 'print "$_: "; s/foo/bar/ if <STDIN> =~ /^y/i'  *
% find /tmp -name '*~' -print | rename 's/^(.+)~$/.#$1/'

The first shell command removes a trailing ".orig" from each filename.

The second converts uppercase to lowercase. Because a translation is used rather than the lc function, this conversion won't be locale-aware. To fix that, you'd have to write:

% rename 'use locale; \$_ = lc(\$_) unless /^Make/' *

The third appends ".bad" to each Fortran file ending in ".f", something a lot of us have wanted to do for a long time.

The fourth prompts the user for the change. Each file's name is printed to standard output and a response is read from standard input. If the user types something starting with a "y" or "Y", any "foo" in the filename is changed to "bar".

The fifth uses find to locate files in /tmp that end with a tilde. It renames these so that instead of ending with a tilde, they start with a dot and a pound sign. In effect, this switches between two common conventions for backup files
